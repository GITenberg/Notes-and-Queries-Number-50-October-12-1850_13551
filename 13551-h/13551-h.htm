<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>A NOTE ON "SMALL WORDS."</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"And ten small words creep on in one dull line."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most ingenious! most felicitous! but let no man despise little
words, despite of the little man of Twickenham. He himself knew
better, but there was no resisting the temptation of such a line as
that. Small words he says, in plain prosaic criticism, are
generally "stiff and languishing, but they may be beautiful to
express melancholy."</p>
<p>The English language is a language of small words. It is, says
Swift, "overstocked with monosyllables." It cuts down all its words
to the shortest possible dimensions: a sort of half-Procrustes,
which lops but never stretches. In one of the most magnificent
passages in Holy Writ, that, namely, which describes the death of
Sisera:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At her feet he bowed, he fell: at her feet he bowed, he fell,
he lay down: where he bowed, there he fell down dead."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are twenty-two monosyllables to three of greater length,
or rather to the same dissyllable thrice repeated; and that too in
common parlance proncounced as a monosyllable. The passage in the
Book of Ezekiel, which Coleride is said to have considered the most
sublime in the whole Bible,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And He said unto me, son of man, can these bones live? And I
answered, O Lord God, though knowest,"&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>contains seventeen monosyllables to three others. And in the
most grand passage which commences the Gospel of St. John, from the
first to the fourteenth verses, inclusive, there are polysyllables
twenty-eight, monosyllables two hundred and one. This it may be
said is poetry, but not verse, and therefore makes but little
against the critic. Well then, out of his own mouth shall he be
confuted. In the fourth epistle of his <i>Essay on Man</i>, a
specimen selected purely at random from his works, and extending
altogether to three hundred and ninety-eight lines, there are no
less than twenty-seven (that is, a trifle more than one out of
every fifteen,) made up <i>entirely</i> of monosyllables: and over
and above these, there are one hundred and fifteen which have in
them only one word of greater length; and yet there are few dull
creepers among the lines of Pope.</p>
<p>The early writers, the "pure wells of English undefiled," are
full of "small words."</p>
<p>Hall, in one of the most exquisite of his satires, speaking of
the vanity of "adding house to house, and field to field," has
these most beautiful lines,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Fond fool! six feet shall serve for all thy store,</p>
<p>And he that cares for most shall find no more!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"What harmonious monosyllables!" says Mr. Gifford; and what
critic will refuse to echo his exclamation? The same writer is full
of monosyllabic lines, and he is among the most energetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id=
"page306"></a>{306}</span> of satirists. By the way, it is not a
little curious, that in George Webster's <i>White Devil, or
Vittoria Corombona</i>, almost the same thought is also clothed in
two monosyllabic lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"His wealth is summed, and this is all his store:</p>
<p>This poor men get, and great men get no more."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Was Young dull? Listen, for it is indeed a "solemn
sound:"&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The bell strikes one. We take no note of time</p>
<p>Save by its loss, to give it then a tongue</p>
<p>Was wise in man."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Was Milton tame? Hear the "lost archangel" calling upon Hell to
receive its new possessor:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">"One who brings</p>
<p>A mind not to be chang'd by place or time.</p>
<p>The mind is its own place, and in <i>itself</i></p>
<p>Can make a heav'n of hell,&mdash;a hell of heav'n.</p>
<p>What <i>matter</i> where, if I be still the same,</p>
<p>And what I should be; all but less than he</p>
<p>Whom <i>thunder</i> hath made <i>greater</i>? Here at least</p>
<p>We shall be free; the <i>Almighty</i> hath not built</p>
<p>Here for his <i>envy</i>; will not drive us hence:</p>
<p>Here we may reign <i>secure</i>; and in my choice</p>
<p>To reign is worth <i>ambition</i>, though in hell:</p>
<p><i>Better</i> to reign in hell, than serve in heav'n!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A great conjunction of little words! Are monosyllables
passionless? Listen to the widowed Constance:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Thou mayst, thou shalt! I will not go with thee!</p>
<p>I will <i>instruct</i> my <i>sorrows</i> to be proud;</p>
<p>For grief is proud, and makes his <i>owner</i> stout;</p>
<p>To me, and to the state of my great grief,</p>
<p>Let kings <i>assemble</i>; for my grief's so great,</p>
<p>That no <i>supporter</i> but the huge firm earth</p>
<p>Can hold it up: here I and <i>sorrow</i> sit;</p>
<p>Here is my throne: bid kings come bow to it."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Six polysyllables only in eight lines!</p>
<p>The ingenuity of Pope's line is great, but the criticism false.
We applaud it only because we have never taken the trouble to think
about the matter, and take it for granted that all monosyllabic
lines must "creep" like that which he puts forward as a specimen.
The very frequency of monosyllables in the compositions of our
language is one grand cause of that frequency passing uncommented
upon by the general reader. The investigation prompted by the
criticism will serve only to show its unsoundness.</p>

<h3>ON GRAY'S ELEGY.</h3>
<p>If required to name the most popular English poem of the last
century, I should perhaps fix on the <i>Elegy</i> of Gray.
According to Mason, it "ran through eleven editions in a very short
space of time." If he means <i>separate</i> editions, I can point
out six other impressions in the life-time of the poet, besides
those in miscellaneous collections viz. In <i>Six Poems by Mr. T.
Gray</i>, London, 1753. Folio&mdash;1765. Folio&mdash;and in
<i>Poems by Mr. Gray</i>, London, 1768. small 8o.&mdash;Glasgow
1768. 4o.&mdash;London. A new edition, 1768. small 8o. A new
edition, 1770. small 8o. So much has been said of translations and
imitations, that I shall confine myself to the text.</p>
<p>Of the <i>first</i> separate edition I am so fortunate as to
possess a copy. It is thus entitled:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>An elegy wrote in a country church-yard</i>. LONDON: printed
for R. Dodsley in Pal-mall; and sold by M. Cooper in
Pater-noster-row, 1751. Price six-pense. 4o six leaves.</p>
<p>"Advertisement.</p>
<p>"The following POEM came into my hands by accident, if the
general approbation with which this little piece has been spread,
may be call'd by so slight a term as accident. It is this
approbation which makes it unnecessary for me to make any apology
but to the author: as he cannot but feel some satisfaction in
having pleas'd so many readers already, I flatter myself he will
forgive my communicating that pleasure to many more.</p>
<p>"The EDITOR."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of this publication is given by Gray himself, in a
letter to Walpole, dated in 1751, and needs no repetition; but I
must observe, as a remarkable circumstance, that the poem was
reprinted <i>anonymously</i>, in its separate form, as late as
1763.</p>
<p>I have collated the editions of 1751 and 1770, and find
variations in stanzas 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 23, 24, and 27. All the
amendments, however, were adopted as early as 1753, except the
correction of a grammatical peccadillo in the ninth stanza.</p>
<p>I make this communication in the shape of a note, as it may
interest men of the world not less than certain <i>hermits</i>.</p>

<hr />
<h3>GRAY'S ELEGY IN PORTUGUESE.</h3>
<p>In several numbers of the "NOTES AND QUERIES" mention is made of
various translations into foreign languages of GRAY'S <i>Elegy in a
Country Church-yard</i>. P.C.S.S. begs leave to add to the list a
very elegant translation into Portuguese, by the Chevalier Antonio
de Aracejo (afterwards Minister of Foreign Affairs at Lisbon and at
Rio de Janeiro), to whose friendship he was indebted many years ago
for a copy of it. It was privately printed at Lisbon towards the
close of the last century, and was subsequently reprinted at Paris
in 1802, in a work called <i>Traductions interlin&eacute;aires, en
six Langues</i>, by A.M.H. Boulard.</p>

<h3>FURTHER NOTES ON THE AUTHORSHIP OF SHAKSPEARE'S HENRY
VIII.</h3>
<p>The Gentleman's Magazine for the present month contains a letter
from Mr. Spedding, the author of the essay which appeared in the
August <span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id=
"page307"></a>{307}</span> number of that magazine on the
authorship of <i>Henry VIII.</i> After expressing himself
"gratified but not surprised" by the coincidence between his views
and those of Mr. Hickson in "NOTES AND QUERIES" (Vol. ii., p.
198.), Mr. Spedding proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The resemblance of the style, in some parts of the play, to
Fletcher's, was pointed out to me several years ago by Alfred
Tennyson (for I do not know why I should not mention his name); and
long before that, the general distinctions between Shakspeare's
manner and Fletcher's had been admirably explained by Charles Lamb
in his note on the <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and by Mr. Spalding in
his Essay. And in respect to this I had myself derived additional
light, more, perhaps, than I am aware of, from Mr. Hickson himself,
if he be (as I suppose he is) the S.H. of the <i>Westminster
Review</i>. But having been thus put upon the scent and furnished
with principles, I followed the inquiry out by myself, without help
or communication. That two independent inquirers should thus have
arrived at the same conclusions upon so many particulars, must
certainly be considered very singular, except upon one supposition;
viz., that the conclusions are according to reason. Upon that
supposition, nothing is more natural; and I must confess, for my
own part, that I should have been more surprised if the coincidence
had been less exact."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will borrow one more paragraph from Mr. Spedding's
communication (which is distinguished throughout by the liberality
of tone of a true scholar), and we doubt not that the wish
expressed at its conclusion is one in which our readers join as
heartily as ourselves:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I hope, however, that Mr. Hickson may be induced to pursue his
own investigation further, and to develop more fully the suggestion
which he throws out as to a difference of style discernible in the
scenes which he attributes to Shakspeare. If I understand him
rightly, he sees traces in this play of the earlier as well as the
later hand of both poets. I cannot say that I perceive any
indications of this myself, nor, if it be so, can I well make out
how it should have come to pass. But I should be glad to hear more
about it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be seen by the following extract from Mr. Emerson's
<i>Representative Men</i>, for which we are indebted to our
correspondent A.R., that the subject had attracted the attention of
that distinguished writer.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <i>Henry VIII.</i>, I think I see plainly the cropping out
of the original rock on which his (Shakspeare's) own finer stratum
was laid. The first play was written by a superior, thoughtful man,
with a vicious ear. I can mark his lines, and know well their
cadence. See Wolsey's Soliloquy, and the following scene with
Cromwell, where, instead of the metre of Shakspeare, whose secret
is, that the thought constructs the tune, so that reading for the
sense will best bring out the rhythm; here the lines are
constructed on a given tune, and the verse has even a trace of
pulpit eloquence. But the play contains, through all its length,
unmistakeable traits of Shakspeare's hand; and some passages, as
the account of the coronation, are like autographs. What is odd,
the compliment to Queen Elizabeth is in the bad rhythm."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SIR HENRY NEVILL.</h3>
<p>Many years ago I copied the following note from a volume of
Berkshire pedigrees in the British Museum, my reference to which is
unluckily lost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Queen Elizabeth, in her first progress at Maidenhithe Bridge,
being mett by all the Nobility, Kn'ts, and Esquires of Berks, they
kneeling on both sides of her way, shee alighted at the bridge
foot, and walked on foote through the midst, and coming just
agaynst Sir Henry Nevill of Billingbear, made a stay, and leyd her
glove on his head, saying, 'I am glad to see thee, <i>Brother
Henry</i>.' Hee, not pleased with the expression, swore she would
make the court believe hee was a bastard, at which shee laughed,
and passed on."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The masquing scene in <i>Henry VIII.</i>, as described by
Holinshed, perhaps furnishes a clue to the Queen's pleasantry,
though Shakspeare has omitted the particular incident relating to
Sir Henry Nevill. The old chronicler, after giving an account of
Wolsey's banquet, and the entrance of a noble troop of strangers in
masks, amongst whom he suspected that the king made one, proceeds
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then the Lord Chamberlain said to the Cardinal, Sir, they
confesse that among them there is such a noble personage whom, if
your Grace can appointe out 'from the rest, he is content to
disclose himself and to accept your place.' Whereupon the Cardinal,
taking good advisement among them, at the last quoth he, 'Me
seemeth the gentleman in the black beard should be even he.' And
with that he arose out of his chaire and offered the same to the
gentleman in the black beard, with his cap in his hand. The person
to whom he offered the chaire was Sir Edward Nevill, a comelie
knight, that much more resembled the king's person in that mask
than anie other. The King perceiving the Cardinal so deceived,
could not forbear laughing, and pulled down his visor and Maister
Nevill's too."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Edward Nevill of Aldington, in Kent, was the second
surviving son of George Nevill, Lord Abergavenny, and the father of
Sir Henry Nevill above mentioned, who laid the foundation-stone and
built the body and one wing of Billingbear House, which still
belongs to his descendant. Sir Edward Nevill was beheaded for high
treason in 1538, his likeness to Henry VIII. not saving him from
the fate which befell so many of that king's unhappy
favourites.</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>
<p><i>Whales.</i>&mdash;Tychsen thinks the stories of whales
mistaken for islands originated in the perplexities of
inexperienced sailors when first venturing from <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>{308}</span> the
Mediterranean into a sea exposed to the tides. I think Dr. Whewell
mentions that in particular situations the turn of the current
occurs at a sufficient interval from the time of high or low water
to perplex even the most experienced sailors.</p>
<p class="author">F.Q.</p>
<p><i>Bookbinding.</i>&mdash;While the mischief of <i>mildew</i> on
the <i>inside</i> of books has engaged some correspondents to seek
for a remedy (Vol. ii., 103. 173.), a word may be put in on behalf
of the <i>outside</i>, the binding. The present material used in
binding is so soft, flabby, and unsound, that it will not endure a
week's service. I have seen a bound volume lately, with a name of
repute attached to it; and certainly the <i>workmanship</i> is
creditable enough, but the <i>leather</i> is just as miserable as
any from the commonest workshop. The volume cannot have been bound
many months, and yet even now, though in good hands, it is
beginning to rub <i>smooth</i>, and to look, what best expresses it
emphatically, <i>shabby</i>, contrasting most grievously with the
leather of another volume, just then in use, bound some fifty or
seventy years ago, and as sound and firm as a drum's

<p><i>Scott's Waverley.</i>&mdash;Some years ago, a gentleman of my
acquaintance, now residing in foreign parts, told me the following
story:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Once upon a time," the great unknown being engaged in a
shooting-match near his dwelling, it came to pass that all the
gun-wadding was spent, so that he was obliged to fetch <i>paper</i>
instead. After Sir Walter had come back, his fellow-shooter chanced
to look at the succedaneum, and was not a little astonished to see
it formed part of a tale written by his entertainer's hand. By his
friend's urgent inquiries, the Scotch romancer was compelled to
acknowledge himself the author, and to save the well nigh destroyed
manuscript of <i>Waverley</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not know whether Sir Walter Scott was induced by
<i>this</i> incident to publish the first of his tales or not;
perhaps it occurred after several of his novels had been printed.
Now, if any body acquainted with the anecdote I relate should
perchance hit upon my endeavour to give it an English garb, he
would do me a pleasure by noting down the particulars I might have
omitted or mis-stated. I never saw the fact recorded.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>BLACK ROOD OF SCOTLAND.</h3>
<p>Can any of your correspondents give me any information on the
following points connected with "the Black Rood of Scotland?"</p>
<p>1. What was the history of this cross before it was taken into
Scotland by St. Margaret, on the occasion of her marriage with
Malcolm, king of Scotland? Did she get it in England or in
Germany?</p>
<p>2. What was its size and make? One account describes it as made
of gold, and another (<i>Rites of Durham</i>, p. 16.) as of
silver.</p>
<p>3. Was the "Black Rood of Scotland" the same as the "Holy Cross
of Holyrood House?" One account seems to make them the same: for in
the <i>Rites of Durham</i>, p. 16., we read,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At the east end of the south aisle of the choir, was a most
fair rood, or picture of our Saviour, <i>in silver</i>, called the
<i>Black Rood of Scotland</i>, brought out of Holyrood House by
King David Bruce, and was won at the battle of Durham, with the
picture of our Lady on the one side, and St. John on the other
side, very richly wrought in silver, all three having crowns of
gold," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another account, in p. 21 of the same work, seems to make them
different; for, speaking of the battle of Neville's Cross (18th
October, 1346), it says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In which said battle a <i>holy Cross</i>, which was taken out
of Holyrood House, in Scotland, by King David Bruce, was won and
taken," &amp;c., p. 21.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And adds,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In which battle were slain seven earls of Scotland.... and also
lost <i>the said cross</i>, and many other most worthy and
excellent jewels ... together with the Black Rood of Scotland (so
termed) with Mary and John, made of silver, being, as it were,
smoked all over," &amp;c., p. 22.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. If they were the same, how is the legend concerning its
discovery by the king, upon Holyrood day, when hunting in a forest
near Edinburgh, to be reconciled with the fact of its being taken
by St. Margaret into Scotland? If they were not the same, what was
the previous history of each, and which was the cross of St.
Margaret?</p>
<p>5. How is the account of Simeon of Durham, that the Black Rood
was bequeathed to Durham Priory by St. Margaret, to be reconciled
with the history of its being taken from the Scotch at the battle
of Neville's Cross?</p>
<p>6. May there not be a connexion between the legend of the
discovery of the "Holy Cross" between the horns of a wild hart
(<i>Rites of Durham</i>, p. 21.), and the practice that existed of
an offering of a stag annually made, on St. Cuthbert's day, in
September, by the Nevilles of Raby, to the Priory of Durham? May it
not have been an acknowledgement <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page309" id="page309"></a>{309}</span> that the cross won at the
battle of Neville's Cross was believed to have been taken by King
David from the hart in the forest of Edinburgh? In the "Lament for
Robert Neville," called by Surtees "the very oldest rhyme of the
North" we read&mdash;</p>

was forbidden to strangers, and confined to the mother country, as
to this day it is with Denmark and her possessions of the Faroe
Islands and Iceland, both mentioned in the paragraph of the

<blockquote>
<p>"Not far from Tame, Roger Durdent held Fisherwicke of the

which I suppose was procured to some of his ancestors of the same

<p>In Shaw's <i>History of Staffordshire</i>, p. 365., fol., 1798,
it is further recorded that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Walter Durdent, in the beginning of Henry II., appears to have
granted it (Fisherwicke) to some of his relations, for we find
William Durdent of Fisherwicke temp. Henry II.; and in the 40th of
Hen. III. Roger Durdent occurs, who held Fisherwicke of the bishop,
24 Ed. I. In the 4 Ed. II. Nicholas Durdent was lord of it."</p>

<p><i>Daniel's Irish New Testament.</i>&mdash;F.G.X. will be much
obliged for information on the following points:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Which is the most correct edition, as to printing and
orthography, of Daniel's Irish New Testament?</p>
<p>2. Does the edition now on sale by the Bible Society bear the
character for incorrectness as to these points, which, judged by
itself, it appears to deserve, or is it really, though "bad, the
best?"</p>
<p>3. F.G.X. is far advanced with an Irish Testament Concordance.
Can any one possessed of the requisite information give him hope of
the acceptableness of such a publication? He should expect it to be
chiefly useful to clerical Irish students in acquiring a knowledge
of words and construction; but the lists of Irish Bibles disposed
of of late years would lead to the supposition of its being
desirable also as pointing out the place of passages to the native
reader.</p>

<p><i>Ale Draper&mdash;Eugene Aram.</i>&mdash;In Hargrove's
well-known history of Eugene Aram, the hero of Bulwer's still
better known novel, one of the guilty associates of the
Knaresborough murderer is designated as an "Ale Draper." As this
epithet never presented itself in my reading, and as I am not aware
that <i>draper</i> properly admits of any other definition than
that given by Johnson, "one who deals in cloth," may I ask whether
the word was ever in "good use" in the above sense?</p>
<p>My main purpose in writing, is to propound the foregoing Query;
but while I have the pen in hand permit me to ask,&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Whether it be possible to read the celebrated "defence," so
called, which was delivered by Aram on his trial at York, without
concurring with the jury in their verdict, and with the judge in
his sentence? In short, without a strong feeling that the prisoner
would not have been hanged, but for that over-ingenious, and
obviously evasive, address, in which the plain averment of "not
guilty" does not occur.</p>
<p>2. Has not the literary character, especially the philological
attainments, of this noted malefactor been vastly over-rated?
And</p>

several undated MSS. written on paper of which it would be very

Swift, and Lady M.W. Montague, as they contain their autographs.
They are all of that size called <i>Pro Patria</i>, and two of them
have as water-mark a figure of Britannia with a lion brandishing a
sword within a paling, and the motto <i>Pro Patria</i> over the
sword. Of one of these the opposite page has the initials GR, and
the other has IX; but the paper has been cut off in the middle of
the water-mark and only exhibits half the figure IV. Another sheet
has the royal arms (1. England and Scotland impaled, 2. France, 3.
Ireland, 4. the white horse of Hanover,) within the garter, and
surmounted by the crown, and on the opposite page GR. within a
crowned wreath. There is no doubt that they were all manufactured

<p><i>Bilderdijk the Poet.</i>&mdash;Banished from his native
country, disowned by his own countrymen, the Dutch poet Willem
Bilderdijk pitched his tent for a while on the hospitable soil of
Old England. Prince William V. residing in 1795 at Hampton Court,
he resolved to stay there; but, possessing no income at all, and,
like the sage of antiquity, having saved nothing from the shipwreck
but his genius, he shifted his dwelling-place to London, where he
gave lessons in drawing, languages, and various, even medical,
sciences. He was married in England to Katharine Wilhelmina
Schweickhardt, on the 18th of May, 1797. His residence in the
birthplace of "NOTES AND QUERIES" makes me ask, if there be still
persons living, who remember him as teacher, friend, or poet? A
presentation-copy of Mrs. Bilderdijk's translation of <i>Rodrick,
the Last of the Goths</i>, was offered to Southey, accompanied by a
Latin letter from her spouse. The poet-laureate visiting Leyden in
the summer of 1825, Bilderdijk would not suffer him to remain
lodged in the inn, where an injury to his leg urged him to favour
the landlord with a protracted stay. Southey was transported
accordingly to the Dutch poet's house; and did not leave it before
he was cured, several weeks having elapsed in the meanwhile.
Mention of this fact is made in a poem the British bard addresses
to Cuninghame. I do not know whether it is alluded to in Southey's
<i>Life</i>.</p>
<p>Bilderdijk's foot was crushed accidentally, in the sixth year of
his age, by one of his play-fellows; and thus he, who, by his
natural disposition seemed to be destined to a military career, was
obliged to enlist in the <i>militia togata</i>. He fought the good
fight in verse. It is remarkable that Byron and Sir Walter Scott,
his cotemporaries, were also lame or limping.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>CURFEW.</h3>
<p>We have received the following Replies to NABOC'S inquiry (Vol.
ii., p. 103.) as to where the custom of ringing the curfew still
remains.</p>
<p><i>Bingley in Yorkshire.</i>&mdash;In the town of Bingley,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id=
"page312"></a>{312}</span> in Yorkshire, the custom of ringing the
curfew existed in the year 1824. It may have been discontinued
since that year, but I do not know that it has.</p>
<p>It is also the custom at Blackburn, in Lancashire; and it was,
if it is not now, at Bakewell in Derbyshire.</p>
<p class="author">H.J.</p>
<p><i>Bromyard, Herefordshire.</i>&mdash;The curfew is still rung
at Bromyard, Herefordshire, at nine P.M., from the 5th of November,
until Christmas Day; and the bell is afterwards tolled the number
of the day of the month. Why it is merely confined to within the
above days, I could never ascertain.</p>
<p class="author">G.F.C.</p>
<p><i>Waltham-on-the-Wolds.</i>&mdash;The curfew is still rung at
Waltham-on-the-Wolds, Leicestershire, at five A.M., eight P.M. in
summer, and at six A.M., seven P.M. in winter; the bell also
tolling the day of the month.</p>
<p class="author">R.J.S.</p>
<p><i>Oxfordshire.</i>&mdash;I see that NABOC's inquiry about the
curfew is answered at p. 175. by a reference to the <i>Journal of
the British Arch&aelig;ological Association</i>. The list there is
probably complete: but lest it should omit any, I may as well
mention, from my own knowledge, Woodstock, Oxon, where it rings
from eight to half-past eight in the evening, from October to
March; Bampton and Witney, Oxon, and Stow, in Gloucester; at some
of which places it is also rung at four in the morning.</p>
<p class="author">C.</p>
<p><i>Chertsey, Surrey.</i>&mdash;In the town of Chertsey in
Surrey, the curfew is regularly tolled for a certain time at eight
every evening, but only through the winter months. There is also a
curious, if not an uncommon, custom kept up with regard to it.
After the conclusion of the curfew, and a pause of half a minute,
the day of the month is tolled out: one stroke for the 1st, two for
the 2nd, and so on.</p>
<p class="author">H.C. DE ST. CROIX.</p>
<p><i>Penrith.</i>&mdash;The curfew bell continues to be rung at
Penrith, in Cumberland, at eight o'clock in the evening, and is the
signal for closing shops, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i>Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</i>&mdash;The curfew is still rung by
all the churches of Newcastle-upon-Tyne at eight in the evening;
and its original use may be said to be preserved to a considerable
extent, for the greater bulk of the shops make it a signal for
closing.</p>
<p class="author">G. BOUCHIER RICHARDSON.</p>
<p><i>Morpeth.</i>&mdash;The curfew bell is still rung at eight
P.M. at Morpeth in Northumberland.</p>
<p class="author">E.H.A.</p>
<p><i>Exeter.</i>&mdash;The curfew is rung in Exeter Cathedral at
eight P.M.</p>
<p>The present practice is to toll the bell thirty strokes, and
after a short interval to toll eight more; the latter, I presume,
denoting the hour.</p>
<p class="author">G.T.</p>
<p><i>Winchester.</i>&mdash;Curfew is still rung at Winchester.</p>
<p class="author">AN OLD COMMONER PREFECT.</p>
<p><i>Over, near Winsford, Cheshire.</i>&mdash;The custom of
ringing the curfew is still kept up at Over, near Winsford,
Cheshire; and the parish church, St. Chads, is nightly visited for
that purpose at eight o'clock. This bell is the signal amongst the
farmers in the neighbourhood for "looking up" their cattle in the
winter evenings; and was, before the establishment of a public
clock in the tower of the Weaver Church at Winsford, considered the
standard time by which to regulate their movements.</p>

then it is also common in the south of Scotland. I have heard it in
Kelso, and other towns in Roxburghshire. The latter circumstance
would appear to prove that it cannot have originated with the
Norman conqueror, to whom it is attributed.</p>

<h3>ENGELMANNS BIBLIOTHECA SCRIPTORUM CLASSICORUM.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 296.)</h4>
<p>The shortest reply to MR. DE MORGAN'S complaint against a
foreign bookseller would be, that <i>Engelmann himself</i> printed
for any of the purchasers of a large number of his Catalogues the
titles to which MR. DE MORGAN objects so much.</p>
<p>Will you allow me to add one or two remarks occasioned by MR. DE
MORGAN'S strictures?</p>
<p>1. Engelmann is not, strictly speaking, a bookseller, and his
catalogues are not booksellers' catalogues in the sense in which
that term is generally received here. He is a publisher and
compiler (and an admirable one) of general classified catalogues
for the use of the trade and of students, without any reference to
his stock, or, in many instances, to the possibility of easily
acquiring copies of the books enumerated: and although he
<i>might</i> execute an order from his catalogues, getting orders
is <i>not</i> the end for which <i>he</i> publishes them.</p>
<p>2. Some foreign houses in London, as well as in other countries,
bought a large number of his Catalogues, not as a <i>book</i> but
as a <i>catalogue</i>, to be supplied to their customers at the
bare cost, or, where it appears advisable, to be delivered gratis
to purchasers of a certain amount.</p>
<p>3. It appears to me pardonable if, under these circumstances, a
notice is inserted on the title, that orders may be directed to the
house which has purchased a number, and supplies them without any
immediate profit; and I may add that I do <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>{313}</span> not
believe any of the houses concerned would object to a notice being
taken of such a proceeding in your paper.</p>
<p>4. The error in omitting the words "from 1700" on the
title-page, is one to which MR. DE MORGAN'S notice first directed
my attention, classics printed before that date not being commonly
in demand among foreign booksellers.</p>
<p>5. The practice of compiling catalogues for general use, with
the names of the purchasers of any number of copies of the
catalogue inserted on the title or wrapper, is very common in
Germany.</p>

English titles, but may be had all over Germany, with the firms of
different booksellers inserted as publishers of the catalogue.</p>

<h3>CROZIER AND PASTORAL STAFF.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 248.)</h4>
<p>A correspondent inquires what was the difference between a
crozier and a pastoral staff. The crozier (<i>Crocia</i>,
Medi&aelig;val Latin), Fr. <i>Crosse</i>, Ital. <i>Rocco
Pastorale</i>, German. <i>Bischofstab</i>, is the ornamental staff
used by archbishops and legates, and derives its name from the
cross which surmounts it. A crozier behind a pall is borne on the
primatial arms of Canterbury. The use of the crozier can only be
traced back to the 12th century. <i>Cavendish</i> mentions "two
great crosses of silver, whereof one of them was for his
archbishoprick and the other for his legatry, always before"
Cardinal Wolsey. The fact did not escape Master <i>Roy</i>, who
sings thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Before him rydeth two Prestes stronge,</p>
<p>And they beare two Crosses right longe,</p>
<p class="i2">Gapinge in every man's face."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Hall</i> says that he removed from Whitehall "with one
cross." In the Eastern Church patriarchs only have a crozier; a
patriarch has two transverse bars upon his crozier, the Pope
carries three.</p>
<p>The pastoral staff was the ensign of bishops. Honorius describes
it as in the form of a shepherd's crook, made of wood or bone,
united by a ball of gold or crystal, the lower part of the staff
being pointed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Evangelio Dominus Apostolis pr&aelig;cepit, ut in
pr&aelig;dcatione nihil pr&aelig;ter virgam tollerent. Et
qui&agrave; Episcopi pastores gregis Dominici sunt, ide&ograve;
baculum in custodi&acirc; pr&aelig;ferunt: per baculum, quo infirmi
sustentatur, auctoritas doctrin&aelig; designatur; per virgam,
qu&agrave; improbi emendantur, potestas regiminis figuratur.
Baculum erg&ograve; Pontifices portant, ut infirmos in Fide per
doctrinam erigant. Virgam bajulant, ut per potestatem inquietos
corrigant: qu&aelig; virga vel baculus est recurvus, ut aberrantes
&agrave; grege docendo ad poenitetiam trabat; in extremo est
acutus, ut rebelles excommunicando retrudat; h&aelig;reticos, velut
lupos, ab ovili Christi potestativ&egrave; exterreat."&mdash;<i>In
Gemm&acirc; Anim&aelig;</i>, lib. i. cap. 218, 219., <i>apud
Hitterpium</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In its primitive form it appears to have been a staff shaped
like a T, and used to lean upon. It was gradually lengthened, and
in some cases was finished at the top like a mace. The pastoral
staff is mentioned in the <i>Life of S. C&aelig;sarius of
Arles</i>. Gough says that the pastoral staff found in the coffin
of Grostete, Bp. of Lincoln, who died in 1254, was made of red wood
ending in a rudely shaped ram's horn. It was inscribed:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Per baculi formam</p>
<p>Pr&aelig;lati discite normam."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the first prayer-book of the Reformed English Church, 2
Edward VI., at the time of the holy communion the bishop is
directed to have "<i>his pastoral staff in his hand, or else borne
by his chaplain</i>." It was used in solemn benedictions; and so
lately as at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth. The second book of
King Edward VI., published A.D. 1552, being revived in that reign,
the use of the staff was discontinued, as we find by the
consecration service of Archbishop Parker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Postq' h&aelig;c dixissent, ad reliqua Communionis solemnia
permit Cicestren. nullu. Archie'po tradens Pastorale
baculum."&mdash;<i>Bramhall</i>, vol. iii. p. 205., Part i. Disc.
5. App., Oxon. 1844.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A crozier was borne at the funerals of Brian Duppa, of Winton,
A.D. 1662; Juxon of London, 1663; Frewen of York, 1664; Wren of
Ely, 1667; Cosin of Dunelm, 1671; Trelawney of Winton, 1721;
Lindsay of Armagh, 1724. It is engraven on the monuments of
Goodrich of Ely, 1552; Magrath of Cashel, 1622; Hacket of
Lichfield, 1670; Creggleton of Wells, Lamplugh of York, 1691;
Sheldon, 1677; Hoadley of Winton, and Porteus of London. Their
croziers (made of gilt metal) were suspended over the tombs of
Morley, 1684, and Mews, 1706. The bishop's staff had its crook bent
outwards to signify that his jurisdiction extended over his
diocese; that of the abbot inwards, as his authority was limited to
his house. The crozier of Matthew Wren was of silver <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>{314}</span> with the
head gilt. When Bp. Fox's tomb was opened at Winchester some few
years since, his staff of oak was found in perfect preservation. A
staff of wood painted in azure and gilt, hangs over Trelawney's
tomb in Pelynt Church, Cornwall. The superb staff of the pious and
munificent founder of the two St. Marie Winton Colleges is still
preserved at Oxford, as is also that of the illustrious Wykehamist,
Bp. Fox, to whose devotion we owe Corpus Christi College in that
university. One of the earliest tombs bearing a staff incised, is
that of Abbot Vitalis, who died in 1082, and may be seen in the
south cloister of St. Peter's Abbey in Westminster. There were
croziered as well as mitred abbots: for instance, the superior of
the Benedictine abbey at Bourges had a right to the crozier, but
not to the mitre. The Abbot of Westminster was croziered and
mitred. I intended to write a reply, but have enabled with a
note.</p>
<p class="author">MACKENZIE WALCOTT, M.A.</p>
<p>7. College Street, Westminster</p>
<p>J.Z.P. will find a fully satisfactory answer to his Query, in
regard to the real difference between the crozier and the pastoral
staff, on referring to the article headed "Crozier," in the
<i>Glossary of Architecture</i>. It is there stated, that "the
crozier of an archbishop is surmounted by a cross; but it was only
at a comparatively late time, about the 12th century, that the
archbishop laid aside the pastoral staff, to assume the cross as an
appropriate portion of his personal insignia." From which it may be
inferred, that the only existent real difference between the
crozier and the pastoral staff is, that the former is surmounted by
a cross, and the latter is as it was before the 12th century, viz.,
surmounted by "a head curled round something in the manner of a
shepherd's crook;" and the difference in regard to their use, that
the crozier pertains to the archbishops, and the pastoral staff to
the bishops.</p>

<h3>PARSONS, THE STAFFORDSHIRE GIANT.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 135.)</h4>
<p>Harwood's note in Erdeswick's <i>Staffordshire</i>, quoted by
your correspondent C.H.B., is incorrect, inasmuch as the writer has
confused the biographies of two distinct "giants"&mdash;WALTER
PARSONS, porter to King James I., and WILLIAM EVANS, who filled the
same office in the succeeding reign.</p>
<p>The best account of these two "worthies" is that found in
Fuller, and which I extract from the original edition now before
me:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WALTER PARSONS, born in this county [Staffordshire], was first
apprenticed to a smith, when he grew so tall in stature, that a
hole was made for him in the ground to stand therein up to the
knees, so to make him adequate with his fellow-workmen. He
afterwards was porter to King <i>James</i>; seeing as gates
generally are higher than the rest of the building, so it was
sightly that the porter should be taller than other persons. He was
proportionable in all parts, and had strength equal to height,
valour to his strength, temper to his valour, so that he disdained
to do an injury to any single person. He would make nothing to take
two of the tallest <i>yeomen</i> of the <i>guard</i> (like the
<i>Gizard</i> and <i>Liver</i>) under his arms at once, and order
them as he pleased.</p>
<p>"Yet were his parents (for aught I do understand to the
contrary) but of an ordinary stature, whereat none will wonder who
have read what <i>St. Augustine</i> (<i>De Civitate Dei</i>, lib.
xv. cap. 23.) reports of a woman which came to <i>Rome</i> (a
little before the sacking thereof by the <i>Goths</i>), of so
giant-like a height, that she was far above all who saw her, though
infinite troopes came to behold the spectacle. And yet he addeth,
<i>Et hoc erat maxim&aelig; admirationis, quod ambo parentes ejus,
&amp;c</i>. This made men most admire, that both her parents were
but of ordinary stature. This <i>Parsons</i> is produced for proof,
that all ages afford some of extraordinary height, and that there
is no general decay of mankind in their <i>dimensions</i>, which,
if there were, we had ere this time shrunk to be lower than
<i>Pigmyes</i>, not to instance in a lesse proportion. This
<i>Parsons</i> died Anno Dom. 1620."&mdash;Fuller's <i>History of
the Worthies of England</i>, 1662 (<i>Staffordshire</i>), p.
48.</p>
<p>"WILLIAM EVANS was born in this county [Monmouthshire], and may
justly be accounted the <i>Giant</i> of our age for his stature,
being, full two yards and a half in height. He was porter to King
<i>Charles I.</i>, succeeding, <i>Walter Persons</i> [sic] in his
place, and exceeding him two inches in height, but far beneath him
in an equal proportion of body; for he was not onely what the
<i>Latines</i> call <i>compernis</i>, knocking his knees together,
and going out squalling with his feet, but also haulted a little;
yet made a shift to dance in an antimask at court, where he drew
little Jeffrey, the dwarf, out of his pocket, first to the wonder,
then to the laughter, of the beholders. He dyed <i>Anno Dom</i>.
1630." <i>Ibid. (Monmouthshire)</i>, p. 54.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From these extracts it will be seen that the Christian name of
Parsons was <i>Walter</i>, not William, as stated by Harwood.
<i>William</i> was the Christian name of Evans, Parsons' successor.
The bas-relief mentioned by the same writer represents William
Evans and Jeffrey Hudson, his diminutive fellow-servant. It is over
the entrance of <i>Bull-head Court</i>, Newgate Street; not "a
bagnio-court," which is nonsense. On the stone these words are cut:
"The King's Porter, and the Dwarf," with the date 1660. This
bas-relief is engraved in Pennant.</p>
<p>There is a picture of Queen Elizabeth's giant porter at Hampton
Court but I am not aware that any portrait of Parsons is preserved
in the Royal Collections.</p>

<h3>EISELL AND WORMWOOD WINE.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 249.)</h4>
<p>If Pepys' friends actually did <i>drink up</i> the two quarts of
<i>wormwood wine</i> which he gave them, it must, as LORD
BRAYBROOKE suggests, have been rendered more palatable than the
<i>propoma</i> which was in use in Shakspeare's time. I have been
furnished by a distinguished friend with the following, among other
Notes, corroborative of my explanation of <i>eisell</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have found no better recipe for making wormwood wine than
that given by old Langham in his <i>Garden of Health</i>; and as he
directs its use to be confined to 'Streine out a <i>little</i>
spoonful, and drinke it with a draught of ale or wine,' I think it
must have been so atrociously unpalatable, that to <i>drink it
up</i>, as Hamlet challenged Laertes to do, would have been as
strong an argumentum ad stomachum as to digest a crocodile, even
when appetised by a slice of the loaf."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident, therefore, that but small doses of this
nauseously bitter medicament were taken at once, and to take a
large draught, <i>to drink up</i> a quantity, "would be an extreme
pass of amorous demonstration sufficient, one would think, to have
satisfied even Hamlet." Our ancestors seem to have been partial to
medicated wines; and it is most probable that the wormwood wine
Pepys gave his friends had only a slight infusion of the bitter
principle; for we can hardly conceive that such "pottle draughts"
as two quarts could be taken as a treat, of such a nostrum as the
<i>Absinthites</i>, or wormwood wine, mentioned by Stuckius, or
that prescribed by the worthy Langham.</p>
<p class="author">S.W. SINGER.</p>
<p>Mickleham, Sept. 30. 1850.</p>
<p><i>Eisell</i> (Vol. ii., p. 242.).&mdash;The attempt of your
very learned correspondent, MR. SINGER, to show that "eisell" was
<i>wormwood</i>, is, I fear, more ingenious than satisfactory. It
is quite true that wormwood wine and beer were ordinary beverages,
as wormwood bitters are now; but Hamlet would have done little in
challenging Laertes to a draught of wormwood. As to "eisell," we
have the following account of it in the "Via Recta ad Vitam longam,
or a Plaine Philosophical Discourse of the Nature, Faculties, and
Effects of all such Things as by way of Nourishments, and
Dieteticale Observations make for the Preservation of Health,
&amp;c. &amp;c. By Jo. Venner, Doctor of Physicke at Bathe in the
Spring and Fall, and at other Times in the Burrough of
North-Petherton, neere to the Ancient Haven Towne of Bridgewater in
Somersetshire. London, 1620."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Eisell, or the vinegar which is made of cyder, is also a good
sauce, it is of a very penetrating nature and is like to verjuice
in operation, but it is not so astringent, nor altogether so cold,"
p. 97.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Feltham's Works</i> (Vol. ii., p. 133.).&mdash;In addition to
the works enumerated by E.N.W., Feltham wrote <i>A Discourse upon
Ecclesiastes</i> ii. 11.; <i>A Discourse upon St. Luke</i> xiv.
20.; and <i>A Form of Prayer composed for the Family of the Right
Honourable the Countess of Thomond</i>. These two lists, I believe,
comprise the whole of his writings. The meaning of the passage in
his <i>Remarks on the Low Countries</i>, appears to be this, that a
person "courtly or gentle" would receive as little kindness from
the inhabitants, and show as great a contrast to their boorishness,
as the handsome and docile merlin (which is the smallest of the
falcon tribe, anciently denominated "noble"), among a crowd of
noisy, cunning, thievish crows; neither remarkable for their beauty
nor their politeness. The words "after Michaelmas" are used because
"the merlin does not breed here, but visits us in October."

illustrates this term:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the margin, at the second line, are the words, <i>The

<p class="author">K.</p>
<p><i>Fool or a Physician&mdash;Rising and Setting Sun</i> (Vol.
i., p. 157.).&mdash;The inquiry of your correspondent C. FORBES,
respecting the authorship of the two well-known sayings on these
subjects, seems to have received no reply. He thinks that we owe
them both to that "imperial Macchiavel, Tiberius." He is right with
respect to the one, and wrong with regard to the other. The saying,
"that a man after thirty must be either a fool or a physician,"
had, as it appears, its origin from Tiberius; but the observation
that "more worship the rising than the setting sun," is to be
attributed to Pompey.</p>
<p>Tacitus says of Tiberius, that he was "solitus eludere medicorum
artes, atque eos qui post tricesimum &aelig;tatis annum ad
internoscenda corpori <span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id=
"page316"></a>{316}</span> suo utilia vel noxia alieni consilia
indigerent." <i>Annal</i>. vi. 46. Suetonius says: "Valetudine
prosperrim&acirc; usus est,&mdash;quamvis a tricesimo &aelig;tatis
anno arbitratu eam suo rexerit, sine adjumento consiliove
medicorum." <i>Tib.</i> c. 68. And Plutarch, in his precepts <i>de
Valetudine tuend&acirc;</i>, c. 49., says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Greek: "Aekousa Tiberion pote Kaisara eipein, hos anaer huper
hexaekonta [sic vulg&ograve;, sed bene corrigit Lipsius ad Tac.
loc. cit. triakonta] gegonos etae, kai proteinon iatro cheira,
katagelastos estin."]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These passages sufficiently indicate the origin of the saying;
but who first gave it the pointed form in which we now have it, by
coupling <i>fool</i> with <i>physician</i>, I am not able to
tell.</p>
<p>The authority for giving the other saying to Pompey, is
Plutarch, who says that when Pompey, after his return from Africa,
applied to the senate for the honour of a triumph, he was opposed
by Sylla, to whom he observed, [Greek: "Oti ton aelion anatellonta
pleiones ae duomenon proskunousin,"] that more worship the rising
than the setting sun&mdash;intimating that his own power was
increasing, and that of Sylla verging to its fall. (<i>Vit.
Pomp</i>. c. 22.)</p>

<p><i>Papers of Perjury</i> (Vol. ii., p. 182.).&mdash;In the
absence of a "graphic account," it may interest your correspondent
S.R. to be referred to the two following instances of "perjurers
wearing papers denoting their crime." In <i>Machyn's Diary</i>,
edited by the accomplished antiquary, John Gough Nichols, Esq., and
published by the Camden Society, at p. 104. occurs the
following:&mdash;</p>

Chepe iij. [men; two] was for the preuerment of wyllfull perjure,
the iij. was for wyllfull perjure, with <i>paper sett over their

</blockquote>
<p>In the same works at p. 250., we have also this additional
illustration:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><i>Pilgrims' Road to Canterbury.</i>&mdash;Being acquainted with
the road to which your correspondent S.H. (Vol. ii., p. 237.)

neighbourhood of Kemsing a tradition is current, that a certain
line of road, which may be traced from Otford to Wrotham, was the
pilgrims' road from <i>Winchester</i> to Canterbury. How far this
may be correct I know not.</p>

<p><i>Capture of Henry VI.</i> (Vol. ii., p. 228.).&mdash;In his
correction of your correspondent, CLERICUS CRAVENSIS, MR. NICHOLS
states:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Both Sir John Tempest and Sir James Harrington of Brierley,
near Barnesley, were concerned in the king's capture, and each
received 100 marks reward; but the fact of Sir Thomas Talbot being
the chief actor, is shown by his having received the larger reward
of 100<i>l.</i>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this statement appears entirely to have been overlooked the
grant of lands made by King Edward IV. to Sir James
Harrington&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For his services in taking prisoner, and withholding as such in
diligence and valour, his enemy Henry, lately called King Henry
VI."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This grant, which was confirmed in Parliament, embraced the
castle, manor, and domain of Thurland; a park, called Fayzet Whayte
Park, with lands, &amp;c. in six townships in the county of
Lancaster; lands at Burton in Lonsdale, co. York; and Holme, in
Kendal, co. Westmoreland, the forfeited lands of Sir Richard
Tunstell, and other "rebels." So considerable a recognition of the
services of Sir James Harrington would seem to demand something
more than the second-rate position given to them by your
correspondent. The order to give Sir James Harrington possession of
the lands under his grant will be found in Rymer. The grant itself
is printed in the <i>Nug&aelig; Antiqu&aelig;</i>, by Henry
Harrington, 1775 (vol. ii. p. 121.), and will, I believe, be found
in Baines' <i>Lancashire</i>. Mr. Henry Harrington observes that
the lands were afterwards lost to his family by the misfortune of
Sir James and his brother being on the wrong side at Bosworth
Field; after which they were both attainted for serving Richard
III. and Edward IV., "and commanding the party which seized Henry
VI. and conducted him to the Tower."</p>

abounding in theatrical anecdote and the "gossip of the

to express my doubts. At one period he filled the post of
sublibrarian to the Prince Regent; and that he was "ardently

BALLOON, in the <i>Penny Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, would give C.B.M. a
good many references. The early works there mentioned are those of
Faujas de St. Fond, Bourgeois, and Cavallo; to which I add the
following: Thomas Baldwin, <i>Airopaidia, containing the Narrative
of a Balloon Excursion from Chester, Sept</i>. 8. 1785. Chester,
1786, 8vo. (pp. 360.).</p>
<p>Vincent Lunardi published the account of his voyage (the first
made in England) in a series of letters to a friend. The title is
torn out in my copy. The first page begins, "An Account of the
First A&euml;rial Voyage in England. Letter I. London, July 15.
1784." (8vo. pp. 66 + ii. with a plate.) It ends with a poetical
epistle to Lunardi by "a gentleman well known in the literary
world" (query, the same who is thus cited in our day?) from which
the following extracts are taken as a specimen of the original
balloon jokes:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The multitude scarcely believed that a man,</p>
<p>With his senses about him could form such a plan,</p>
<p>And thought that as Bedlam was so very nigh,</p>
<p>You had better been there than turned loose in the sky.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<hr /></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"In their own way of thinking, all felt and all reasoned,</p>

<p><i>Concolinel</i> (Vol. ii., p. 217.).&mdash;I have been many
years engaged in researches connected with <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>{318}</span> the
<i>original</i> music of Shakspeare's Plays, but it has not been my
good fortune to meet with the air of <i>Concolinel</i>. The
communication of your correspondent R. is of the greatest interest,
and I should be for ever grateful if he would allow me to see the
manuscript in question, in order that I might test the
<i>genuineness</i> of the air "stated, in a recent hand, to be the
tune of <i>Concolinel</i> mentioned by Shakspeare."</p>
<p>This air has double claims on our attention, as its existence,
in any shape, is placed amongst the "doubtful" points by the
following note extracted from the Rev. J. Hunter's <i>New
Illustrations of Shakspeare</i>, vol. i. p. 268.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Concolinel. In the absence of any thing like sufficient
explanation or justification of this word, if word it is, I will
venture to suggest the possibility that it is a corruption of a
stage direction, <i>Cantat Ital.</i>, for <i>Cantat
Italic&eacute;</i>; meaning that here Moth sings an Italian song.
It is quite evident, from what Armado says, when the song was
ended, 'Sweet air!' that a song of some sort was sung, and one
which Shakespeare was pleased with, and meant to praise. If Moth's
song had been an English song, it would have been found in its
place as the other songs are."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, for one, cannot subscribe to Mr. Hunter's suggestion that our
great poet intended an <i>Italian</i> song to be sung in his play
and for this reason, that Italian music for a <i>single voice</i>
was almost unknown in this country in 1597, at which date we know
<i>Love's Labour's Lost</i> was in existence. Surely
<i>Concolinel</i> is just as likely to be the burden of a song as
<i>Calen o Custure me</i>, mentioned in <i>Henry the Fifth</i> (Act
iv. sc. 4.), of which there is now no doubt.</p>
<p>I may just mention, in passing, that I have discovered the air
of <i>Calen o Custure me</i> in a manuscript that once belonged to
Queen Elizabeth, and have ample proof that it was an especial
favourite with her maiden majesty. The commentators were at fault
when they pointed out the more modern tune of the same name in
Playford's <i>Musical Companion</i>, 1667.</p>

<p><i>Swords worn in Public</i> (Vol. ii., p. 218.)&mdash;A very
respected and old friend of mine, now deceased, used to relate that
he had often seen the celebrated Wilkes, of political notoriety,
walking in the public streets, dressed in what is usually termed
court dress, wearing his sword. Wilkes died in 1797. In connexion
with this subject it may be interesting to your readers to know
that in 1701 it was found necessary to prohibit footmen wearing
swords. An order was issued by the Earl Marshal in that year,
declaring that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas many mischiefs and dangerous accidents, tending not
onely to the highest breach of the peace, but also to the
destruction of the lives of his Ma'ties subjects, have happend and
been occasioned by Footmen wearing of Swords, for the prevention of
the like evill accidents and disturbance for the future, I doe
hereby order that no Foot-man attending any of the Nobilitye or
Gentry of his Ma'ties Realms, during such time as they or any of
them shall reside or bee within the Cities of London or Westm'r,
and the Liberties and Precincts of the same, shall wear any Sword,
Hanger, Bagonet, or other such like offensive weapon, as they will
answer the Contempt hereof." Dated 30th Dec. 1701.</p>

<p><i>Speech given to Man to conceal his Thoughts</i> (Vol. i., p.

Florentine Machiavelli. The German writer Ludwig B&ouml;rne
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Macchiavelli, der die Freiheit liebte, schrieb seinem Prinzen
so, dass er alle rechtschaffenen Psychologen in Verlegenheit und in
solche Verwirrung gebracht, dass sie gar nicht mehr wussten, was
sie sprachen und sie behaupteten, Macchiavelli habe eine politische
Satyre geschrieben."</p>

<p><i>The Character "&amp;,", and Meaning of "Parse"</i> (Vol. ii.,
pp. 230. 284.).&mdash;This character, being different from any of
the twenty-four letters, was placed at the end of the alphabet, and
children, after repeating their letters, were taught to indicate
this symbol as <i>and-per-se-and</i>. Instead of spelling the word
<i>and</i>, as composed of three letters, it was denoted by a
special symbol, which was "<i>and by itself, and</i>." Hence the
corruption, an <i>ampussy and</i>.</p>
<p>The word <i>parse</i> is also derived from the Latin <i>per
se</i>. To <i>parse</i> a sentence is to take the words <i>per
se</i>, and to explain their grammatical form and etymology.</p>

<p><i>Wife of Edward the Outlaw</i> (Vol. ii., p. 279.).&mdash;With
reference to the Query of E.H.Y. (Vol. ii., p. 279.), there seems
to be much confusion in all the accounts of Edward's marriage. I
think it is evident, from an attentive consideration of the various
authorities, that the Lady Agatha was <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>{319}</span> either
sister to Giselle, wife of <i>Stephen</i>, King of Hungary (to whom
the young princes must have been sent, as <i>he</i> reigned from
A.D. 1000 till A.D. 1038), and sister also to the Emperor Henry
II., or, as some writers seem to think, she was the daughter of
Bruno, that emperor's brother. (See a note in Dr. Lingard's
<i>History</i>, vol. i. p. 349.)</p>
<p>That she was not the <i>daughter</i> of either Henry II., Henry
III., or Henry IV., is very certain; in the first case, for the
reason stated by your correspondent; and in the second, because
Henry III. was only twelve years old when he succeeded his father
Conrad II. (in the year 1039), which of course puts his son Henry
IV. quite out of the question, who was born A.D. 1049. It strikes
me (and perhaps some of your correspondents will correct me if I am
wrong) that the two English princes <i>may</i> have respectively
married the two ladies to whom I have referred, and that hence may
have arisen the discrepancies in the different histories: but that
the wife of Edward the Outlaw was <i>one</i> of these two I have no
doubt.</p>

inquiries respecting Roman Catholic translations of the Scriptures.
The saying of the Duke of Lancaster is found in the first edition
of Foxe's <i>Acts and Monuments</i>, and in the modern reprint, iv.

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>No one branch of antiquarian study has been pursued with greater
success during the last few years than that of Gothic Architecture;
and, to this success, no single work has contributed in any
proportion equal to that of the <i>Glossary of Terms used in
Grecian, Roman, Italian, and Gothic Architecture</i>. Since the
year 1836, in which this work first appeared, no fewer than four
large editions, each an improvement upon its predecessor, have been
called for and exhausted. The fifth edition is now before us; and,
we have no doubt, will meet, as it deserves, the same extended
patronage and success. When we announce that in this fifth edition
the text has been considerably augmented by the enlargement of many
of the old articles, as well as by the addition of many new ones,
among which Professor Willis has embodied a great part of his
<i>Architectural Nomenclature of the Middle Ages</i>; that the
number of woodcuts has been increased from eleven hundred to
seventeen hundred; and lastly, that the Index has been rendered far
more complete, by including in it the names of places mentioned,
and the foreign synonyms; we have done more to show its increased
value than any mere words of commendation would express. While the
only omission that has been made, namely, that of the utensils and
ornaments of the Medi&aelig;val Church (with the exception of the
few such as altars, credences, piscinas, and sedilias, which belong
to architectural structure and decoration), is a portion of the
work which all must admit to have been foreign to a Glossary of
Architectural Terms, and must therefore agree to have been wisely
and properly left out. The work in its present form is, we believe,
unequalled in the architectural literature of Europe, for the
amount of accurate information which it furnishes, and the beauty
of its illustrations; and as such, therefore, does the highest
credit both to its editor and to its publisher; if, indeed, the
editor and publisher be not identical.</p>

&amp;c. Quarto; with a Portrait; handsomely printed in 4to.;
half-bound in morocco, 15<i>s.</i></p>
<p>This interesting MS., so frequently alluded to by Dr. Burney in
the course of his "History of Music," has been kindly placed at the
disposal of the Council of the Musical Antiquarian Society, by
George Townshend Smith, Esq., Organist of Hereford Cathedral. But
the Council, not feeling authorised to commence a series of
literary publications, yet impressed with the value of the work,
have suggested its independent publication to their Secretary, Dr.
Rimbault, under whose editorial care it accordingly appears.</p>
<p>It abounds with interesting Musical Anecdotes; the Greek Fables
respecting the origin of Music; the rise and progress of Musical
Instruments; the early Musical Drama; the origin of our present
fashionable Concerts; the first performance of the Beggar's Opera,

<p>The present Work contains a full collection of the harmonized

Psalm Chants. They are given in full score, and in their proper
cliffs. In the upper part, however, the treble is substituted for
the "cantus" or "medius" cliff: and the whole work is so arranged
as to suit the library of the musical student, and to be fit for
use in the Choir.</p>

the Talbotype from facsimile tracings of the original; together
with various other plates and numerous wood engravings.</p>
<p>In the Quarto edition the folding of the plates necessary for
the smaller volume is avoided.</p>
<p>"These heads (Ceres, Flora, and Pomona) are of a high order of

kind, every tessella apparently being represented.</p>
<p>"Our authors have very advantageously brought to their task a
knowledge of geology and chemistry, and the important aid which an
application of these sciences confers on arch&aelig;ology, is
strikingly shown in the chapter on the materials of the
tessell&aelig;, which also includes a valuable report by Dr.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
